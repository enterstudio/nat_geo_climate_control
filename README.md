## Programming challenge
Build a circuit and write the embedded software necessary to control a simple climate.

## What is a control system?
It is a system with a feedback loop that has one or more inputs about the system (sensing) and one or more ways to affect the system (outputs/actuation) to produce a desired state.  [Control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory)

## Simple climate control
We will build a simple system to attempt to control humidity.  The sensor will tell us the relative humidity and we can lower it by controlling the speed of a fan pointed at it.

## Set up your development system
  * Use Windows or Mac PC with USB port.
  * Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
  * Download this [Arduino library code](/arduino_libraries.zip), unzip the file and put the folders in your `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries directory.`
  * Download this [example code](/arduino_test_programs.zip), and unzip the file and put the folders in your `~/Documents/Arduino` directory.
  * Plug the USB cable into your PC and the Arduino board (without any circuits).
  * Start the Arduino IDE (to open and compile the test programs)
    * IDE > Tools (make sure board says "mega 2560", and pick the port you are using - should be /dev/cu.usb...)
    * IDE > File > Open... > pick "am2315_test"
    * Click the "upload" right arrow in the menu bar to make sure the sketch compiles and uploads.
    * Click the "serial monitor" button in the upper right corner of the window.
    
## Components
  * Arduino mega 2560 and USB cable.
  * Small bread board and handful of male to male jumper wires.
  * 12V PC fan - look for low current ones.
  * [AM2315](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/AM2315.pdf) temperature and humidity sensor with male pins on its wires.  
  * PN2222 transistor.
  * 1N4001 diode.
  * 220 or 270 Î© resistor.

## Wiring the circuit
  * AM2315:
    * Red wire to 5V on Arduino
    * Black wire to GND on Arduino
    * Yellow wire to SDA pin 20 on Arduino (I2C)
    * White wire to SCL pin 21 on Arduino (I2C)
  * Breadboard:
    * Put each of the 3 legs of the transistor into their own row (left, middle, right facing the flat side of the transistor)
    * Connect the NON-silver banded end of the diode into the RIGHT leg row of the transistor.
    * Connect the black negative fan wire to the RIGHT leg row of the transistor.
    * Connect the red positive fan wire to the silver banded end of the diode row.
    * Connect the Arduino 5V output to the silver banded end of the diode row.
    * Connect the resistor to the middle transistor row and to a row farther out (to pin 3).
    * Connect the Arduino pin 3 to the far end of the resistor (away from the transistor).
    * Connect the left leg row of the transistor to the Arduino GND.

## Testing the circuit
  * Start the Arduino IDE and open the `am2315_test.ino` sketch code.  
    * Upload it and watch the humidity values change if you blow on it.
    * Remember to open the serial monitor window.
    * How long does the sensor take to return to the ambient humidity?
  * Now open the `PWM_test.ino` file and upload it to the Arduino board.
    * Play with the duty cycle it takes to control your fan with pulse width modulation (PWM).
    * Do you notice that the fan won't run if the duty cycle is too low?

## Programming
  * Overview of the sensor, I2C and its frequency (.5 Hz).
  * Overview of the PWM for the 12V fan (using 5V and a transistor so the digital output is not driving the fan)
  * Overview of Arduino programming:
    * C++ with utility classes (String, Serial, etc).
    * Embedded, so the only way to get debugging output is from the serial port (or blinking an LED).
    * Why `setup()` and `loop()` special functions?
  * **Using the two test programs, can you write a control program that reads the sensor and uses the fan to reduce (or hold) the humidity at a set level?**  
    * (hint: if you get stuck, open simple_climate.ino to see one implementation)
    * Here is some example output in the serial monitor from one of my tests:
